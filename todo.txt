bugs:
click on an inactive color on the popup-palette hides the popup
    the bug appears if the page's height is too short (for example, dev tools is open on the bottom of the window)
    and the popup doesn't fit the page, so you need to scroll down.
    If the page is scrolled, the calculation of outOfY goes wrong, and the popup is being closed coz of hideOnOuterClick
    Meanwhile, if an active color was clicked, the activeCell's color is being changed.
recalculation of the popup-palette X (left) on zoom goes wrong
